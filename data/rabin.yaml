# PASCAL VOC dataset http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/
# Train command: python train.py --data voc.yaml
# Default dataset location is next to /yolov5:
#   /parent_folder
#     /VOC
#     /yolov5


# download command/URL (optional)
#download: bash data/scripts/get_voc.sh

# train and val data as 1) directory: path/images/, 2) file: path/images.txt, or 3) list: [path1/images/, path2/images/]
#train: ../VOC/images/train/  # 16551 images
#val: ../VOC/images/val/  # 4952 images  

# We simply concat source data A and a few target data B for domain-aware data augmentation
# other types of merging can also be explored and probably get better results :)
